# Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Definition: AI is math and code that makes decisions about data. 

Keep those words in mind every time you hear the word AI. And every time you hear the words "machine learning" or "deep learning." There is no simpler or more practical way to define artificial intelligence. Every time AI is used, some one is relying on math and code to make decisions about data. 

The math and code will be any one of a variety of algorithms. The definition of algorithm is simply a combination of math and logic, and the logic is written in code.<sup>[1](#one)</sup>
