# Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Definition: AI is math and code that makes decisions about data. 

Keep those words in mind every time you hear the word AI. Every time you hear the words "machine learning" or "deep learning." There is no simpler or more practical way to define artificial intelligence. Every time AI is used, someone somewhere is relying on math and code to make decisions about data.<sup>[1](#one)</sup>  

The math and code will be any one of a variety of algorithms. The definition of algorithm is simply a combination of math and logic, and the logic is written in code. Those algorithms come under different names: deep artificial neural networks, support-vector machines, Gaussian models, multilayer perceptrons, LSTMs, convolutional networks, logistic regression, random forests. AI specialists will bandy about a swarm of terms related to these algorithms, their properties, and the technology used to implement them. People outside the field of AI just need to remember that all these terms are just algorithms, and they are used to make predictions about data.<sup>[1](#one)</sup>  

Predictions eat information you have and spit out information you don't have. For example, you can use historical data on traffic on a bridge to forecast future traffic on that bridge. You could also use the pixels in an X-ray to predict the likelihood that those pixels indicate the presence of cancer. In both cases, you used old data to make a prediction, to generate new information. 

Here's what's cool: Making decisions about data, making those predictions, can be very costly.
