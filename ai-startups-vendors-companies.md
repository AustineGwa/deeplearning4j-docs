# AI Startups and Machine Learning Vendors

## AI Startups, Data Science Tooling Companies, AI Infrastructure & Platforms

### Skymind

Skymind is an open-core, **machine-learning operations** company that helps data science and engineering teams to deploy their trained AI models to production. The [Skymind Intelligence Layer (SKIL)](https://skymind.ai/platform) solves infrastructure problems when productionizing TensorFlow, sci-kit learn and Keras models. The Skymind machine learning server acts as an embeddable AI backend for prominent software and hardware vendors seeking to bundle machine learning functions into their offering. It works on-prem, on the public cloud and in the hybrid cloud, facilitating a multi-cloud strategy to prevent lockin for large enterprise clients. The embeddable machine learning backend has a small footprint, plugs into numerous data sources and data pipelines, and works on all major operating systems. Skymind created the open-source framework Eclipse Deeplearning4j and the scientific computing library [ND4J](nd4j.org). Founded in 2014, headquarted in San Francisco and Tokyo. 

### Datarobot

[Datarobot](https://www.datarobot.com/) claims to [automate machine learning](./automated-machine-learning-ai.html), offering a GUI for business analysts (clickers, not coders) to run their data through multiple machine learning models in order to identify the most suitable algorithm for the problem. In a sense, it is like a subset of [RPA](./robotic-process-automation-rpa.html) focused on predictive machine-learning tasks. [Founded in 2012](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datarobot), based in Boston, raised $111 million as of 2018.

### Domino Datalab

[Domino Datalab](https://www.dominodatalab.com/) is a data science platform supporting a collaborative environment for data science teams, usually on a managed cloud. Their tool provides transparency into the work of individual contributors and accelerates teamwork. [Founded in 2013](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/domino-data-lab), based in San Francisco, raised $41 million as of 2018. 

### Sentient

[Sentient Technologies](https://www.sentient.ai/) is an AI vendor focused on evolutionary algorithms (and neural networks) that sells tools for maximizing digital marketing conversions, customer engagement in e-commerce and trading strategies for asset management. 

### BigML

[BigML](https://bigml.com/) is a machine-learning startup operating on a SaaS business model but also offering private deployments. [Founded in 2011](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bigml), based in Corvallis, Oregon, and Barcelona, Spain, raised $1.6 million. 

### Dataiku

[Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/) is a collaborative data science platform with a special focus on data pipelines, or ETL, for which it offers a pleasant GUI. [Founded in 2013](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dataiku), headquarted in New York and Paris, raised $45.7 million as of 2018.
