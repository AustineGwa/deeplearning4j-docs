# AI Winter and the War on AI

There are two kinds of AI pessimists: The kind that believes AI will become so strong that it destroys humanity, and the kind that believes AI is so flawed, weak, and overhyped that the sector will collapse. 

They both receive lots of attention, although their claims are mutually exclusive. What that should tell you is that people like to read prophecies of doom: messages that arouse fear go viral. These doomsday prophets play to our insecurities. Much like a politician seeking re-election might launch a war on terror or a war on drugs, there is a strange war on AI being waged by those on the edge of the technology. Their message of decline implies that they are superior due to their foresight, and that the rest of the world is headed blindly for disaster. 

```
“For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell.” - Deirdre McCloskey (historian)

“I have observed that not man who hopes when others despair, but the man who despairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of persons as a sage.” - John Stuart Mill
```

Discussions of AI are polarized. 



They are becoming more and more politicized.  


footnote?
In financial markets, these pessimists are called bears, and their optimistic counterparts are called bulls. Bulls and bears both have biases that color their predictions, and lead them to seek evidence support their beliefs. Being a bull or bear is not so much a matter of being right or wrong, since both tend to be right and wrong sometimes.
