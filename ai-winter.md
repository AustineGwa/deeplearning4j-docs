# AI Winter and the War on AI

There are two kinds of AI pessimists: The kind that believes AI will become so strong that it destroys humanity, and the kind that believes AI is so flawed, weak, and overhyped that the sector will collapse. 

Both types of AI pessimist receive a lot of attention, although their claims are mutually exclusive. People like to read prophecies of doom: messages that arouse fear go viral. These doomsday prophets play to our insecurities. Like a politician seeking re-election might launch a war on terror or a war on drugs, there is a strange war on AI being waged by those who stand at the edge of the technology. Their message of decline implies that they are superior due to their foresight, and that the rest of the world is headed blindly for disaster. 

```
“For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell.” - Deirdre McCloskey (historian)

“I have observed that not man who hopes when others despair, but the man who despairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of persons as a sage.” - John Stuart Mill
```

Discussions of AI are polarized. 



The issue of AI is becoming more and more politicized, and the political polarization has multiple axes. Political polarization has led to partisanship, paranoia and a loose relationship with the facts. In such situations, it's easy to see how both sides are wrong, or arguing unfairly. 

Domestically within most developed countries, there are those who believe that AI will destroy jobs through automation vs. those who believe that AI will create new industries and offset that unemployment. 

Internationally, there are those who believe the major powers are in an AI arms race, and those who believe that AI is developing fast and well based on the sharing of knowledge among research groups. 



footnote?
In financial markets, these pessimists are called bears, and their optimistic counterparts are called bulls. Bulls and bears both have biases that color their predictions, and lead them to seek evidence support their beliefs. Being a bull or bear is not so much a matter of being right or wrong, since both tend to be right and wrong sometimes.
