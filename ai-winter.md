# AI Winter: Deep learning and its Discontents

An [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) is a time when funding and support for artificial intelligence research and startups dries up. AI went through various winters in the 20th century, when early promise turned to disappointment and the best technologists turned their minds to other problems.  

In our time, there are two kinds of AI pessimists: One believes AI will become so strong that it destroys humanity, and another believes AI is so flawed, brittle, and overhyped as a technology that the sector will collapse. The first is afraid of killer robots, the second predicts that the next AI winter is on its way. Both kinds receive a lot of attention, although their claims are mutually exclusive. 

Everyone likes prophecies of doom: messages that arouse fear go viral. These doomsday prophets play to our insecurities. Like a politician seeking re-election might launch a war on terror or a war on drugs, there is a strange war on AI being waged by those who stand at the edge of the technology. Their message of decline implies that they are superior due to their foresight, and that the rest of the world is headed blindly for disaster.

“For reasons I have never understood, people like to hear that the world is going to hell.” - Deirdre McCloskey (historian)

“I have observed that not man who hopes when others despair, but the man who despairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of persons as a sage.” - John Stuart Mill
```

## Polarization

Discussions of AI are multipolar and increasingly polarized. That is, people are gravitating toward more and more extreme views about the future of AI and its impact on society. In addition to the two kinds of pessimism described above, you have AI hype. The boosters who seek to succeed alongside the technology. It is in their interest to make promises about AI, and to view a world with stronger AI through rose-colored glasses.

As you can see, at the center of all this sturm and drang, the real work of researching and implementing AI continues. 

## Politics

The issue of AI is becoming more and more politicized, and the political polarization has multiple axes. Political polarization has led to partisanship, paranoia and a loose relationship with the facts. In such situations, it's easy to see how both sides are wrong, or arguing unfairly. 

Domestically within most developed countries, there are those who believe that AI will destroy jobs through automation vs. those who believe that AI will create new industries and offset that unemployment. 

Internationally, there are those who believe the major powers are in an AI arms race, and those who believe that AI is developing fast and well based on the sharing of knowledge among research groups.

### Footnotes

* *In financial markets, these pessimists are called bears, and their optimistic counterparts are called bulls. Bulls and bears both have biases that color their predictions, and lead them to seek evidence to support their beliefs. Being a bull or bear is not so much a matter of being right or wrong as never being right at the same time as your opposite number. There's usually someone who calls the market right, and they play musical chairs with everyone else.*
