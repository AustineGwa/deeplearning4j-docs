# Automated Machine Learning and AI

One of the way AI vendors try to convince companies to buy their machine learning platforms and tools is by claiming that it's automated. That's a key selling point, because most companies are acutely aware that they haven't hired enough data scientists (even they have managed to hire any data scientists at all). 

Data scientists are people who explore data, clean it, test algorithms that they think might make accurate predictions about that data, and then tune those algorithms until they work well, like an auto mechanic might tune a car. Here's a more complete list of [tasks in the machine learning workflow](./machine-learning-workflow.html).

If the data scientists are lucky, they are given tools to perform those tasks efficiently, and they may even be enabled to deploy those trained machine-learning models to a production environment, to make predictions about data outside the lab.

Many machine learning vendors, ranging from Google to startups such as Datarobot and H2O.ai, claim that they can automate machine learning. That sounds great! Then you, the hiring manager, won't need to go chasing after data science talent whose skills you can't judge in a bidding war you can't win. You'll just automate all those skills away. 

The problem is, the skills that data scientists possess are hard to automate, and people who seek to buy automated AI should be aware of what exactly can be automated, and what can't, with present technology.
