# How CIOs Should Think about Machine Learning and AI

For purposes of this post, we're going to treat AI, machine learning and deep learning as interchangeable terms, and we'll just refer to them as "AI" for the sake of brevity. (If you're interested in the differences between them, we compare the [definitions of AI and machine learning here](./ai-machinelearning-deeplearning).)

It's important for companies and leaders who are trying to adopt AI to share a common language with their teams of software engineers and data scientists. Too often, advanced technology is shrouded in jargon and obfuscations that are obstacles to understanding and fast implementation. The goal of this post is to introduce a set of terms and ways of thinking that can serve as a common language for teams that are starting to build AI solutions.

## What Does AI Do?

The most important thing to know about AI is what it can do for you. **AI makes decisions about data.** Just imagine the AI as a box: you send data into the box, and decisions about the data come out. 

What kinds of decisions can you make? There are four types of decisions that people rely on AI for:

* Classification
* Clustering
* Regression
* Goal-oriented moves

Let's look at a couple examples of each:

* **Classification**: Classification is identifying something: categorizing or tagging or sorting it. Putting a name to a face is a classification problem. Filtering emails into a spam folder uses an algorithmic filter to classify them as `spam` or `not_spam`. Detecting objects in images can be a classification problem. So can recognizing voices. More broadly, this is an example of machine perception, of an algorithm that maps raw sensory data to symbols that have meaning for humans. In this way, AI can interpret or give meaning to data, much as the human brain does in a flash of cognition. To train a classifier, you need a labeled dataset; i.e. you need to tag data with the names that apply to it, like pairing a JPEG with the name of the person in the photo. The way people tend to do this is by sorting data into folders with the label that applies. The algorithm then learns the correlations between the data (e.g. pixels in the shape of my face) and the label (e.g. my name). So the first question to ask, after you have decided on the outcomes or labels you want to predict, is "Do we have data labeled with those outcomes? And if not, how do we get it?" (At that point, you start looking at data strategies: how to gather and process the data to train your algorithms on.)

* **Clustering**: Clustering algorithms group data by similarity. They recognize pieces of data that resemble each other, and they can gather them in one place visually to enable easy data exploration. For example, we could feed 1,000 faces of men, women and children into an algorithm, and without knowing what men, women or children are, the algorithm would group women in one corner, men in another and children in a third. That's clustering. A clustering algorithm can recognize similarities between a search query and a set of documents, to surface relevant web sites. In reverse photo search, it can look at pixel patterns and serve up similar images, without knowing how to name the objects in the images. The inverse of similarities are anomalies, and algorithms can recognize those, too. Anomaly detection has application in use cases such as fraud detection and predictive maintenance, since fraud and equipment breakdowns usually exhibit symptoms of unusual activity, whether it is strange financial transactions, or weird data generated by the sensors attached to heavy equipment. 

* **Regression**: Regression just means predicting continuous numerical values. (Classification, in contrast, predicts discrete values. The animal in the photo might be a dog or an elephant or a peacock, but it is not a mix of those categories. With discrete values, there are no gray areas or gradual shifts in values.) For example, houses might be sold for any amount from $100,000 to $3,000,000. You want to predict the price of the house based on its square footage. The larger the house is, the more it is likely to cost, but the relationship between square feet and dollars is not one to one. This is a regression problem that might be expressed as `house_price = slope * square_feet + intercept`. Algorithms can learn the correlations between numerically continuous values as well. 

* **Goal-oriented**: Goal-oriented learning is best described in terms of a video game. In a video game, certain actions win you more points, while others will cost you. That is, there's a correlation between what you do and the amount of points you gain or lose. Algorithms can learn the relationship between your actions and the rewards a game returns to you. Some of these algorithms are called "[reinforcement learning](./deepreinforcementlearning)". Google created an algorithm called AlphaGo that learns those correlations for the board game of Go, and it learned them so well that the algorithm beat the world champion of Go. If you can define problems to be solved as games to be won, and strictly define how points are awarded, then you can apply goal-oriented learning to real-life situations as well. For example, you might reward a robot for successfully pushing a button, or you might reward a drone for every second it remains aloft. In finance, you might teach an algorithm to correlate the buying and selling of securities with the profit or loss it incurs. 

If you can't formulate the problem you want to solve as one of these four types of predictions, then you need to start over. Until you achieve strategic clarity over the outcomes you want to predict, it's not much use fiddling with AI. 

## What Does AI Need to Work?

To build an AI solution, you need four things:

* Data
* Team
* Tooling
* Infrastructure

We'll explore each in turn. There are technological solutions, and vendors to sell them, which solve for tooling and infrastructure. Getting the right data and team is harder. 

* Data

Once you've defined the problem you want to solve, the next question to ask is: "Do I have the data that's pertinent to this problem?" That data is the fuel your algorithms need. Without it, they cannot be trained, and will not be able to make accurate predictions. 

**AI begins with gathering the right data** for the problem that's important to you. If you don't have that data, you need to take a step back and devise a data strategy. That strategy might detail the steps necessary to identify the proper data, gather it, move it to a data lake and store it there.  

In the previous section, we listed the types of problems that AI can solve. Below, we'll list many of the major data types that AI can work with:

* Text
* Time Series
* Tabular data
* Images
* Video
* Sound
* Voice

Many of these data types require no explanation. Every one knows what an image is. 

### What's a Time Series?

Others are slightly less common: not every one is familiar with the term "time series". A time series is data that is recorded over time, where the sequence of the data is important. For example, temperature readings thrown off by a thermometer come in a series over time. You could take a reading each second, or each minute, and that series of temperatures would contain patterns. 

A thermometer measuring the outdoor temperature would peak in the early afternoon and reach its low point sometime after midnight in a daily cycle. That's a regular pattern, and on the basis of that pattern, an algorithm can both make predictions about future temperatures, as well as recognize anomalous behavior when the temperature doesn't behave as expected. 

Attaching a thermometer as a sensor to a piece of heavy equipment can reveal patterns about the machine's internal state: extremely high temperatures at the wrong time might signal that something is going wrong. That's the basis of a preventative maintenance that uses AI. 

Other forms of time series data include server logs that monitor the behavior of machines in your data center; web logs that track the behavior of customers on your website; data packets flowing in and out of your servers (that has clear cybersecurity applications); monthly consumption figures used for market forecasting and inventory planning; and many other sensors the monitor the health of patients (think vital statistics measured in a hospital) and machines.

### Tabular Data

Tabular data, also referred to as columnar data, is the kind of data you find in a relational data base. If you've ever worked with a spread sheet, where each row is a different *thing* and each column records a different aspect of the thing, then you know what columnar data is. For example, each row might be a person with a unique ID, and each column would record a piece of metadata about that person, like height, weight, gender, address, etc. 

While recent advances in AI have highlighted its superhuman accuracy in image recognition and voice detection, most business problems involve either text, time series or tabular data. And deep learning applies equally well to those. Which is to say, deep learning opens the possibility that on old business problems, like fraud detection or market forecasting, companies can cut their error rate in half. Those leaps in accuracy have a monetary value, which only the business itself can know. And those leaps in accuracy are the reason why enterprise is adopting AI technology. 

### What's a Tensor?

Algorithms such as deep artificial neural networks can work with any type of data, as long as it's a tensor. ;) That is, to feed data into a neural net, you need to transform it with a data pipeline focused on machine learning. That data pipeline takes in data in any form, and it outputs a tensor. 

What's a tensor? It helps to start with something simpler and build up. A single number like `5` is called a scalar. When you stack those scalars one on top of another, like cells in column in a spread sheet, that's a vector. When you take several columns and place them next to each other, as we do with spread sheets, you have an array. And if you place those two-dimensional arrays on top of each other like pages in a book, that's a tensor. A tensor is an array with three or more dimensions. You can actually keep adding dimensions beyond three, but it's more difficult to visualize. In any case, tensors are the basic data structure that deep learning algorithms work with.
