# How CIOs Should Think about Machine Learning and AI

For purposes of this post, we're going to treat AI, machine learning and deep learning as interchangeable terms, and we'll just refer to them as "AI" for the sake of brevity. (If you're interested in the differences between them, we compare the [definitions of AI and machine learning here](./ai-machinelearning-deeplearning).)

It's important for companies and leaders who are trying to adopt AI to share a common language with their teams of software engineers and data scientists. Too often, advanced technology is shrouded in jargon and obfuscations that are obstacles to understanding and fast implementation. The goal of this post is to introduce a set of terms and ways of thinking that can serve as a common language for teams that are starting to build AI solutions.

## What Does AI Do?

The most important thing to know about AI is what it can do for you. **AI makes decisions about data.** Just imagine the AI as a box: you send data into the box, and decisions about the data come out. 

What kinds of decisions can you make? There are four types of decisions that people rely on AI for:

* Classification
* Clustering
* Regression
* Goal-oriented moves

Let's look at a couple examples of each:

* **Classification**: Classification is identifying something: categorizing or tagging or sorting it. Putting a name to a face is a classification problem. Filtering emails into a spam folder uses an algorithmic filter to classify them as `spam` or `not_spam`. Detecting objects in images can be a classification problem. So can recognizing voices. More broadly, this is an example of machine perception, of an algorithm that maps raw sensory data to symbols that have meaning for humans. In this way, AI can interpret or give meaning to data, much as the human brain does in a flash of cognition. To train a classifier, you need a labeled dataset; i.e. you need to tag data with the names that apply to it, like pairing a JPEG with the name of the person in the photo. The way people tend to do this is by sorting data into folders with the label that applies. The algorithm then learns the correlations between the data (e.g. pixels in the shape of my face) and the label (e.g. my name). So the first question to ask, after you have decided on the outcomes or labels you want to predict, is "Do we have data labeled with those outcomes? And if not, how do we get it?" (At that point, you start looking at data strategies: how to gather and process the data to train your algorithms on.)

* **Clustering**: Clustering algorithms group data by similarity. They recognize pieces of data that resemble each other, and they can gather them in one place visually to enable easy data exploration. For example, we could feed 1,000 faces of men, women and children into an algorithm, and without knowing what men, women or children are, the algorithm would group women in one corner, men in another and children in a third. That's clustering. A clustering algorithm can recognize similarities between a search query and a set of documents, to surface relevant web sites. In reverse photo search, it can look at pixel patterns and serve up similar images, without knowing how to name the objects in the images. The inverse of similarities are anomalies, and algorithms can recognize those, too. Anomaly detection has application in use cases such as fraud detection and predictive maintenance, since fraud and equipment breakdowns usually exhibit symptoms of unusual activity, whether it is strange financial transactions, or weird data generated by the sensors attached to heavy equipment. 

* **Regression**: Regression just means predicting continuous numerical values. (Classification, in contrast, predicts discrete values. The animal in the photo might be a dog or an elephant or a peacock, but it is not a mix of those categories. With discrete values, there are no gray areas or gradual shifts in values.) For example, houses might be sold for any amount from $100,000 to $3,000,000. You want to predict the price of the house based on its square footage. The larger the house is, the more it is likely to cost, but the relationship between square feet and dollars is not one to one. This is a regression problem that might be expressed as `house_price = slope * square_feet + intercept`. Algorithms can learn the correlations between numerically continuous values as well. 

* **Goal-oriented**: Goal-oriented learning is best described in terms of a video game. In a video game, certain actions win you more points, while others will cost you. That is, there's a correlation between what you do and the amount of points you gain or lose. Algorithms can learn the relationship between your actions and the rewards a game returns to you. Some of these algorithms are called "[reinforcement learning](./deepreinforcementlearning)". Google created an algorithm called AlphaGo that learns those correlations for the board game of Go, and it learned them so well that the algorithm beat the world champion of Go. If you can define problems to be solved as games to be won, and strictly define how points are awarded, then you can apply goal-oriented learning to real-life situations as well. For example, you might reward a robot for successfully pushing a button, or you might reward a drone for every second it remains aloft. In finance, you might teach an algorithm to correlate the buying and selling of securities with the profit or loss it incurs. 

If you can't formulate the problem you want to solve as one of these four types of predictions, then you need to start over. Until you achieve strategic clarity over the outcomes you want to predict, it's not much use fiddling with AI. 

## What Does AI Need to Work?

Once you have defined the problem you want to solve, the next question you have to ask is: Do I have the data that's pertinent to this problem. That data is the food your algorithms need. Without it, they will not be able to make accurate predictions. AI begins with gathering the right data for the problem that's important to you. If you don't have that data, you need to take a step back, and devise a data strategy.
