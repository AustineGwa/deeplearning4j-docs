# How CIOs Should Think about Machine Learning and AI

For purposes of this post, we're going to treat AI, machine learning and deep learning as interchangeable terms, and we'll just refer to them as "AI" for the sake of brevity. (If you're interested in the differences between them, we compare the [definitions of AI and machine learning here](./ai-machinelearning-deeplearning).)

It's important for companies and leaders who are trying to adopt AI to share a common language with their teams of software engineers and data scientists. Too often, advanced technology is shrouded in jargon and obfuscations that are obstacles to understanding and fast implementation. The goal of this post is to introduce a set of terms and ways of thinking that can serve as a common language for teams that are starting to build AI solutions.

## What Does AI Do?

The most important thing to know about AI is what it can do for you. **AI makes decisions about data.** Just imagine the AI as a box: you send data into the box, and decisions about the data come out. 

What kinds of decisions can you make? There are four types of decisions that people rely on AI for:

* Classification
* Clustering
* Regression
* Goal-oriented moves
