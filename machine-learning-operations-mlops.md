# Machine Learning Operations (MlOps)

Machine learning operations is the machine-learning equivalent of DevOps: it solves the problems of implementing machine-learning in production, notably around the technology infrastructure and tooling necessary to deploy machine-learning algorithms and data pipelines reliably and scalably, so as not to destabilize other parts of the stack. 

## Machine Learning Server

Machine learning faces challenges to scaling at the four main stages of its workflow:

* ETL (Data pipelines)
* Algorithm training
* Inference
* Monitoring, Management and Updates

The Skymind Intelligence Layer (SKIL) is a [machine learning server](./machine-learning-server.html) that solves the problem of serving machine-learning models at scale during the inference phase.
