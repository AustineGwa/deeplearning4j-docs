# Robotic Process Automation (RPA), AI and Deep Learning

RPA automates business workflows, or clerical processes, by emulating human interaction within a graphical user interface (GUI). 

For example, RPA can record a series of tasks taken in a GUI, such as cursor moves and buttons clicks, and translate that series of actions to code, so that those tasks can be performed without human intervention in the future.

RPA can be optimized for some GUI actions by applying machine- and deep-learning algorithms to perception problems, like recognizing a button or an edit field. Given the graphical nature of RPA, deep learning's image recognition capabilities are perfectly suited to the task. You might say that the "software robot" of RPA is the arms and legs, and the machine learning component is the "brain". 

Machine learning models can be inserted into RPA workflows to perform machine perception tasks, like image recognition: tasks that the human brain can perform in a second, whose output can be plugged into a larger flow of business logic.
