# Signature Recognition with Machine Learning

Signature recognition is one application of machine learning to automate business processes with the help of a visual workflow technology such as RPA. The most effective signature recognition involves a general model for feature extraction, and specific models for each signature in question. In that sense, it might be more appropriate to call this application *signature verification* or *validation*, since we are seeking to confirm whether or not a given signature belongs to a given individual.
