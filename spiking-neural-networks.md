# Spiking Neural Networks

WIP.

Spiking is a way to encode digital communications over a long distance (the spike rate and timing of individual spikes relative to others), because analog values are destroyed when sent a long distance over an active medium. But analog works fine locally. So spikes are close similar to packets in mesh interconnect. Pure spiking works in all-purpose machines like CPUs and GPUs, but hardware's numeric capacity present is wasted, and it doesn't use scarce random access memory bandwidth optimally.

## SNN Advantages

* Low energy usage
* Greater parallelizability due to local-only interactions
* (Maybe) better able to learn non-differentiable functions
