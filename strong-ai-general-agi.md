# What Is Strong AI? What Is General AI?

First let's start with the synonyms: strong AI, general AI, artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence all basically refer to the same thing. And what they refer to is an algorithm or ensemble of algorithms that can perform all tasks as well as or better than humans. And to be clear, that does not exist. Not only does strong AI not exist as anything more than an idea, but we don't know how to get there yet. 

We call it strong because we imagine it will be strong than us. We call it general because it will apply to all problems. The opposite of strong AI is weak AI. The opposite of general AI is narrow AI. 

As these words are being written in 2018, we live in an age of weak AI. Weak AI is an algorithm that has been trained to do one thing, and it does that one thing very well. For viewers familiar with [the movie Rainman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/), Dustin Hoffman's character is a good analogy for weak AI: good at solving a few very specific problems (like counting match sticks on the floor), bad at life. The AI that data scientists are deploying to the world right now is a bunch of machine-learning models, each of which performing one task well. They are like a crowd of savants babbling their narrow responses to the world.
