# A Beginner's Guide to Supervised Learning

You may have heard the terms "supervised learning". It is a way to conduct machine learning. It's not an algorithm exactly. In a supervised learning scenario, you have input data which has been labeled.

Imagine your algorithm is taking a test. The labels are the correct answers to the test, and the input data is the set of questions. Your algorithm is going to take a guess each time it sees a data instance, and that guess will be checked against the correct answer, the label. The act of supervision, then, is this checking of guesses against correct answers. 

We don't always have a labeled dataset, or know the answers to our questions, so not all learning is supervised. [Unsupervised learning](./unsupervised-learning.html) is a topic for another post.
